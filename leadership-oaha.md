Unami Lodge, One offers a High Adventure and National Events Scholarship to youth Arrowmen of our lodge by up to $250 to attend one of the National Order of the Arrow High Adventure programs at Philmont Scout Ranch, Northern Tier, Summit Bechtel Reserve, and the Florida High Adventure Sea Base or a National Event, like National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC).

This scholarship is reserved for those individuals who exhibit interest and service as well as a future commitment to the Order of the Arrow and Unami Lodge, One. It is expected of the recipients to continue their service in the OA as well as bring their enthusiasm gained from these programs back to our lodge, your chapter, and unit. Each recipient will be required at the end of their experience to provide the lodge with an account of their experiences that can be posted on the lodge website for recognition and promotion for the programs and the scholarship.
