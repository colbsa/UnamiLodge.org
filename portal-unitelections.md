Thank you for your interest in completing a unit election in Unami Lodge, One. New members are vital to the continued success of our organization. All units are encouraged to hold a visitation each year, even if there are no eligible candidates. Learn more about the different parts of an election below.

## Requesting an Election/Visitation
All Troops, Ships, and Crews within the Cradle of Liberty Council are eligible to hold one unit election per calendar year. Beginning in April of 2022, all units who have not been marked as having completed an election will begin receiving an automated email from Lodgemaster, our membership tracking system. Elections in 2022 must be completed and reported by September 30th. 

If you would like to schedule a unit election or visitation prior to receiving a request email, please contact the lodge Unit Elections Committee at [unitelections@unamilodge.org](/contact?recipient=unitelections) or your chapter leadership, as found [on this page](https://unamilodge.org/chapters/find).


## Conducting an Election
Once you've requested an election, a team from Unami Lodge will work with you to schedule a date and location. To ensure a successful election, please announce the date in advance to your unit members so they will be sure to attend that evening. Remember, at least 50% of your unit’s active members must be present to conduct an election. Any Arrowmen in your unit are encouraged to wear their OA sash on the night of the election.

    Please note - you may not complete an election for your own unit. Please continue to attend your unit meeting and participate in the election, but the visitation must be completed by other Arrowmen.

    The Unit Elections committee has assembled some useful materials for those completing unit elections. Materials can be found in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0AKCkQheUkudwUk9PVA">UL - Lodge Executive Committee Google Drive</a>, shared with all members of the LEC. If you need access, please contact either the Unit Elections or Communications committees.

## Recording Election Results & Nominating Adults
Upon the completion of your unit election, election teams will confirm the results with the unit leader. Results can either be announced that night, or held for future announcement at a call-out. If held, a date must be chosen as to when results can be announced. ***Keep in mind - the clock on the candidate's induction opportunity starts at the time of election, not announcement.***

Once the unit elections' team makes a report, you'll receive a copy of the election results for your records. Included in that email will be a link to nominate any adults in your unit. The number of adults you can nominate will be based on how many youth were elected. Adult nominees are notified immediately upon approval.

Elected candidates, both youth and adult, will receive further information from Unami Lodge about completing their ordeal. Additional information for elected candidates can be found [here](https://unamilodge.org/electedcandidates/). Candidates have up to 24 months from election to complete their induction.

    As a reminder, Unami Lodge has retired our previous Google Forms for reporting election results in favor of the new Inductions Module built into <a href="https://lodgemaster-client.oa-bsa.org/">LodgeMaster</a>. Please contact the Unit Elections committee if you need help accessing or entering elections.

    Additionally, please enter election results in a timely manner. Unit leaders cannot submit adult nominations until youth results have been entered and approved. The Inductions Module does not notify any youth candidates of their election until the call-out date has been reached.
