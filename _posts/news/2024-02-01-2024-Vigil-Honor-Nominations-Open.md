The Vigil Honor is a high mark of distinction and recognition reserved for those Arrowmen who, by reason of exceptional service, personal effort, and unselfish interest, have made distinguished contributions beyond the immediate responsibilities of their position of office to one or more of the following: Lodge, Order of the Arrow, Scouting Community, Scout Camp. The Vigil is the highest honor a lodge can bestow on one of its members to recognize an innate alertness to the needs of others.

If you believe you know an Arrowman deserving of this honor, you can now submit a nomination on UnamiLodge.org/awards. The only requirement is that the nominee be a brotherhood member for at least 2 years. Remember: You DO NOT need to be a Vigil yourself in order to submit a nomination for a deserving brother. All youth and adults are encouraged to nominate if they find someone worthy of the honor.
