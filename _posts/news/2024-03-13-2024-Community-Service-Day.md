The Service Committee has made the decision to postpone the Community Service Day due to the inclement weather conditions this coming Saturday. The committee will review the feasibility of rescheduling this event sometime in 2024.  The committee extends our gratitude to Pennypack Park and the Friends of Mount Moriah for partnering with the lodge’s Community Service Day.

Yours in the Brotherhood

Gloves and water is recommended. Anyone is more than welcome to bring their own yard tools.** Lunch will not be provided, so individuals may pack a lunch or snack, or units that are attending together may have members volunteer to bring snacks. It would be a great help for any registered scouts or scouters to attend, and make sure you spread the word in your Chapter, Troop, Ship, or Crew! Remember that the event is open to everyone so encourage them to attend as well.
