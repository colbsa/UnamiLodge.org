As an Ordeal member, your focus should be on providing leadership to your home unit. After 6 months as an Ordeal member, you have the opportunity to take the next step in your membership journey and become a Brotherhood member. As a Brotherhood member, your focus should shift to now serve the lodge as well, and providing leadership on the chapter or lodge level.

Becoming a Brotherhood member publicly shows your commitment to the Order of the Arrow and its ideals. The Brotherhood Trail – your journey towards Brotherhood membership – highlights the lessons and traditions learned during the Ordeal and provides you with in depth information about continuing your involvement on the lodge and chapter level. Unami offers opportunities for completing the Brotherhood Trail and sealing the bonds of Brotherhood at any of our three lodge weekends, as well as at Resica Falls Scout Reservation during the summer.

To sign-up and seal the bond, head over to the [Lodge Calendar](calendar) page. Please note: your lodge dues must be paid for you to become a Brotherhood member of the Order of the Arrow.

We look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming opportunities to seal your membership. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the Brotherhood Committee at [brotherhood@unamilodge.org](contact?recipient=brotherhood).
