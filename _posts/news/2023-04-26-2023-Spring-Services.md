Brothers,

Thank you to all those who joined us for Spring Service One! This was our biggest service weekend in over a decade, all because of our amazing members and candidates who came out for an amazing time! We had over 265 people in attendance, we welcomed 100 new Ordeal Members and 40 Brothers Sealed their Bond of Brotherhood!

If you would like to view photos from this weekend, [you can do so on our Lodge Flickr Page at flickr.com/unamilodge](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjAAUNR)

If you did not attend Spring Service One, donâ€™t worry Spring Service Two is just around the corner! Join us for an exciting water themed weekend at Resica Falls Scout Reservation on May 19th - 21st! Embark on your Ordeal, Seal your Bond of Brotherhood, or join us for some Cheerful Service!

Thank you again for joining us at Spring Service One and we hope to see you at Spring Service Two!
