      Do you want to meet thousands of Arrowmen from across the country? Are you interested in learning about the future of the OA? Are you an avid patch collector? Interested in more training? Then join us for the National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC)! NOAC is the premier event of the Order of the Arrow and is Scouting’s second-largest national event. In 2024, several thousand Arrowmen from across our nation will gather at the University of Colorado - Boulder from July 29th to August 3rd, 2024 to participate in this once in a lifetime event.

      This National event features:
      <ul>
        <li>World Class Training</li>
        <li>Lodge Competitions</li>
        <li>Ceremony Competitions</li>
        <li>Shows and Fellowship</li>
        <li>Patch Trading</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      This NOAC will be the first conference west of Iowa since 1988! The lodge is still working out our travel plans, but we expect the cost of the event will be $1,350.00 for both youth and adult members. This cost includes your conference fee, airfair, meals, a set of Unami patches, Unami t-shirts, and a limited edition duffle bag.

      We hope you’ll join our lodge at the conference as we engage with more than 200 other lodge contingents in competitions, fellowship, and stadium shows! Registration opens on September 1st and requires a $200 deposit to lock-in your spot.
