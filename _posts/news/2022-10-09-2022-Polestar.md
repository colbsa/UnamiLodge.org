- *Did you have an amazing induction experience and do you want to replicate that for others?*
- *Do you think you have what it takes to bring our inductions to the next level?*
- *Are you at all interested in how our organization gains new members?*

If you answered "Well... I guess?, yeah, maybe, hmmm" or anything remotely positive, then you may be interested in attending the Order of the Arrow's newest training experience.

Polestar is a Nationally developed training program, where the trainers that will guide you through this session have been trained and accredited by the National Order of the Arrow. Do you want to know more about how others have responded to this new training?
