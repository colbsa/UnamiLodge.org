Hello newly inducted members to Unami Lodge, One!

Are you interested in learning more about how our lodge operates?  
Are you interested in attending another event?  
Are you interested in getting involved in a committee or your chapter but don't know what all the opportunities are? 

You are invited to join us for an evening of fellowship at Gravity Vault where you can participate in rock climbing and get to know our Lodge! Lodge officers and committee chairs will be there to meet and introduce you to some of the exciting heights our Lodge has to offer. This is a perfect chance to get a deeper understanding of how the lodge and committees work!

**Fellowship, fun, and snacks are all free! Climbing is optional but will only be $5!** If you would like to climb, [please fill out this form before arriving](https://intake.gravityvault.com/radnor). This must be done by a parent / guardian if you are under 18.
