Seal your Bond of Brotherhood at Musser Scout Reservation on Saturday November 11th. The Brotherhood Blitz is a shortened lodge weekend, where Brotherhood candidates seal their bond on a short schedule! Candidates perform service, walk the brotherhood trail, do their ceremony, and then leave camp in time to be home for dinner!

Anyone who completed their Ordeal May 11th or before is eligible to Seal their Bond of Brotherhood at the Blitz. Being a Brotherhood member signifies full membership into The Order of the Arrow. During your Brotherhood induction process, you learn more about the lodge and the different roles within it. After your process, your focus for service changes to serving the lodge through service in committees and positions, in addition to serving your unit. Sealing your Bond is your gateway to strengthening your ties to the lodge.

We look forward to seeing all eligible members at this year's Blitz! Email brotherhood@UnamiLodge.org with any questions.
