Check-in for the service projects will be between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, with the projects being finished around noon. **Please wear appropriate attire for the work projects. Gloves and water is recommended. Anyone is more than welcome to bring their own yard tools.** Lunch will be provided by Mount Moriah Cemetery! It would be a great help for any registered scouts or scouters to attend, and make sure you spread the word in your Chapter, Troop, Ship, or Crew!
