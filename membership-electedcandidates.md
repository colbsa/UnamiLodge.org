Congratulations on your election to the Order of the Arrow, Scouting’s National Honor Society.
To be chosen by your fellow Scouts for membership is a great honor, and you should be proud of
your election. As a candidate for membership, you more than likely have many questions.
Hopefully, this page answers them all for you, and prepares you for the next step in your
journey!

<h2>What is the Order of the Arrow?</h2>
The Order of the Arrow is Scouting’s National Honor Society. Each local BSA council has their own group of the
Order of the Arrow called a lodge. Our lodge, Unami Lodge, One is the first lodge founded. In 1915, Dr. E. Urner
Goodman and Carroll A. Edson began the Order of the Arrow at Treasure Island Camp to recognize those Scouts
and Scouters who best exemplified the Scout Oath and Scout Law in their daily life – just like you! In 1948, the
Order of the Arrow became an official program of the Boy Scouts of America. In 2019, membership in the Order of
the Arrow expanded to welcome new members from Scouts BSA troops, Venturing crews, and Sea Scout ships,
both male and female participants alike.

<h2>What is the Purpose of the Order of the Arrow?</h2>
At its core, the Order of the Arrow has four main areas of purpose: To recognize those who best exemplify the Scout
Oath and Law in their daily lives. To promote camping, responsible outdoor adventure, and environmental
stewardship in the unit, year-round and in summer camp. To develop leaders with the willingness, character, spirit,
and ability to advance the activities of their units, our Order, and Scouting. To crystallize the Scout habit of
helpfulness into a life purpose of leadership in cheerful service to others.

<h2>When can I complete my Ordeal?</h2>

<h2>Why is the Ordeal such a big secret?</h2>
Unami Lodge, One does not intend to keep any information from its newly elected candidates. However, any
secrecy around the Ordeal is meant for a single purpose: the Experience. Revealing too much information before the
Ordeal would hurt the full experience of your membership journey. The Ordeal is meant to be a chance for you to
reflect on Scouting and grow in your service to others.

<h2>What should I bring to my Ordeal?</h2>
Ten Essentials: Sleeping Bag, Sleeping Pad, Tarp, Tent with ground cloth (for after your Ordeal), work clothes,
work gloves, personal grooming gear, full Field (Class A) Scout Uniform (for your induction ceremony), a current
and complete BSA Medical form (along with any prescription medications), and A POSITIVE SCOUT
ATTITUDE!

Make sure you check out the [Ordeal Packing Instructions](/files/OrdealPackingInstructions.pdf) for more details.
