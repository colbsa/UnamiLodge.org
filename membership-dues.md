While you are always considered a member of the Order of the Arrow from the time of your induction, to be an "active member" your lodge dues must be paid annually. Paying your lodge dues supports the general operating budget of the lodge and gives more youth opportunities to participate in national programs. Being a dues paying member allows for you to participate in lodge events, wear the lodge flap proudly on your uniform, and ensures you receive updates and communications from the lodge. Click on the link below to pay your lodge dues and become an active member of Unami Lodge, One.

# Accessing the OA Member Portal

The Order of the Arrow has recently introduced a Member Portal, though which you can do the
following:
- Update your contact information (email/phone/mailing address)
- View the lodge calendar
- Find links to register for events
- Check if your dues are paid
- Contact lodge leadership with questions

In addition, recently elected members whose units opted to inform them of their election prior to their ordeal can access information to help you prepare for your Ordeal, and recently inducted members will have access to information to help you on your journey to Brotherhood.

You must be 13 years of age or older to get a Member Portal account. Currently there is no access for parents to accounts of members who are under 13, either. A future update should add the ability for parents of members under 13 to access on their behalf.

Currently, new portal accounts are automatically issued to newly-elected candidates after their election results have been announced, or to newly-inducted members after they pass their ordeal, whichever happens first, provided that their election was reported via the new LodgeMaster Inductions module which became available for the entire lodge in the upcoming election cycle.

## Already have access the Member Portal

Once you’ve linked your account, you can get to the member portal by going to [portal.oa-bsa.org](https://portal.oa-bsa.org/)

## Do not have a Member Portal account, see below
### Get an Arrow ID account

The Order of the Arrow has a single-sign-on system called Arrow ID which is used to access any official Order of the Arrow resources (such as the national registration system used for NOAC and NLS/DYLC, LodgeMaster, and the Member Portal). If you’ve ever attended NOAC or NLS, you probably already have an account. You will need an Arrow ID account first before you can access the Member Portal.

1. Go to [id.oa-bsa.org/Account/Register](https://id.oa-bsa.org/Account/Register)
2. Fill in your name, your email address, and the password you want to use for your account and submit the form.
3. Click **Register**.
4. Follow any directions given to complete your registration.

## Get a Member Portal Invitation

You will need an invitation from your lodge to get a portal account. If you haven’t previously received a portal invitation, you can send an email to membership@unamilodge.org to request one. The invitation will include a code you can use to link your Arrow ID to your OA member record.

Click the link in the invitation email. If you get prompted to log in, then do so using your Arrow ID login. After you’ve logged in, go back to the email and click the link again. If it doesn’t automatically link your account, click the red “Have an invite?” button near the top, choose “Member Portal” for the application. Our council is #525 Cradle of Liberty. Then paste in the code from the email and click “Add”.
