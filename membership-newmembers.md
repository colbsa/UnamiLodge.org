## Join in the Fellowship – Come Out to a Lodge Activity
From the beginning, you can continue your active membership in Unami Lodge, One by attending a variety of lodge activities, including:
- Lodge Service Weekends held each April & May. Come out and perform cheerful service at our council camps, meet fellow arrowmen, and participate in some awesome evening programs!
- Lodge Fellowship Weekends held in October. Perform a half day of cheerful service, and enjoy a fun-filled afternoon and evening of exciting activities! Also, come out and vote in the yearly Lodge Officer Elections.
- Section E17 Conclave held in early June. Each lodge in the section – the 10 lodges from the councils surrounding us – takes turns hosting this action-packed weekend of training, fellowship, and fun! The 2023 Section E17 Conclave’s theme is "Brotherhood Beach Bash" and being held at Citta Scout Reservation.
- Annual Dinner held every January. The oldest standing event in the Order of the Arrow, our lodge banquet highlights the accomplishments of all the members of the lodge throughout the year, recognizes the recipients of awards for outstanding and camp service, and begins the term of the new lodge officers.
- Community Service Day held in March. Held in three distinct areas throughout the council, the Community Service Day is a way for members of our lodge to give service to our local communities. Past locations have included Pennypack Park, Mount Moriah Cemetery, and the Valley Forge Medal of Honor Grove.
