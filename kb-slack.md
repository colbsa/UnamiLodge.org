<h3 class="mt-5">Getting Started</h3>

To access Unami Lodge's Slack workspace, simply visit: [UnamiLodge.Slack.com](https://unamilodge.slack.com)

Outside of the base workspace link, Slack's documentation is really awesome, so we're going to defer to them for the most up to date information.  If you're new to the platform, getting started is super easy:

2. [Getting started for new Slack users](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users)
