My Brothers,

I am humbled and privileged to serve as the 105th lodge chief of Unami Lodge, One, and I appreciate each and every one of you for trusting me with this opportunity. Currently, I am a junior at MaST II Community Charter School, and the president of our school’s technical theater program. Following high school, I plan to join the Philadelphia Fire Department. In my troop, I am a life scout from Troop 160 in Burholme, PA. I have been a Scout for 12 years, since the age of four, beginning all the way back when I was a Lion Cub in Cub Scouts. 

In the summer of 2021, I faithfully completed my Ordeal. Instantly after joining the Order of the Arrow (OA), I fell in love with the program and couldn’t get enough. Two weeks after I was inducted, I became the Roosevelt Vice Chapter Chief at the young age of 13. The next year, in 2022, I did my Brotherhood and became the Roosevelt Chapter Chief, as well as the Lodge Operations Chair. The following year in 2023, I kept the same roles, in addition to becoming an Events Vice Chair. In 2024, I was privileged to serve as the lodge’s First Vice Chief. This would present opportunities unlike any other, and I am so grateful for the friendships I have made along the way. Through these many years, I have been privileged to attend many lodge, section, region, and national events all throughout the country. As the Lodge Chief of Unami Lodge, I am determined to give every new Arrowman the opportunity that I had when I was younger. 

The 2025 Lodge Executive Committee is made up of some of our most passionate Arrowmen, and are ecstatic to start the year off strong. There is no doubt in my mind that they will do the best job they can. Our advisory board is made up of strong adult leaders that are willing to offer aid wherever needed. 

I am proud of every single member of Unami Lodge, and I encourage you all to come back to our events and enjoy the Order of the Arrow in its entirety. 

Yours in Service,  
Martin S.
