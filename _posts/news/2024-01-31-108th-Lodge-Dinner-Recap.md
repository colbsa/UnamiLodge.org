Thanks to everyone who joined us for this year's Annual Lodge Dinner! We greatly enjoyed meeting up with many of our friends, but we missed many of you as well. Here is a recap of what happened for those who missed it or those who want to relive it.

Some notable highlights of the dinner were:

- [Induction of the 2024 Officers](/officers/)
- [4 Dave Fortunator OSA Recipients](/history/awards/adult-osa)
- [4 Tom Richards OSA Recipients](/history/awards/youth-osa)
- [6 Chuck Benshetler Spirit of Camp Leadership Award Recipients](/history/awards/camp-leadership)
- [3 Founder's Award Recipients](/history/awards/founders)

[Make sure to check out the photo album to see all of these and more!](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjB9LGs)

Don't forget to [stay tuned for upcoming events](/calendar). The Community Service Day is quickly approaching and Unami Lodge is offering a merit badge college February 24! If you plan on going to all of our weekends this year, there is still time to [sign up for a Turtle Power Pass](https://scoutingevent.com/525-68803)!
