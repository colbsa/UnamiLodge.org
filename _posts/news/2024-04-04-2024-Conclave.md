Brothers,

As April flies by, it brings us one step closer to Conclave! Sign-ups for the second E17 Conclave are open! This yearâ€™s Conclave will be held at Camp NoBeBoSco on June 7-9. Unami Lodge One, is striving to be the largest lodge at conclave for the fifth year in a row. The big red button is one of the easiest ways to sign up for Conclave with the click of a button. The Conclave Committee is so excited to see you all there!

FYI, Camp NoBeBoSco is a smaller camp, so registration is limited. Make sure to sign up as soon as possible to not miss this event!
