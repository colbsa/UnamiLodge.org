Check-in for the service projects will be between 8:30 and 9:00 AM, with the projects being finished around noon. **Please wear appropriate attire for the work projects. Gloves and water is recommended. Anyone is more than welcome to bring their own yard tools.** Lunch will not be provided, so individuals may pack a lunch or snack, or units that are attending together may have members volunteer to bring snacks. It would be a great help for any registered scouts or scouters to attend, and make sure you spread the word in your Chapter, Troop, Ship, or Crew! Remember that the event is open to everyone so encourage them to attend as well.

Questions? Reach out to the contact person for your service project or [service@UnamilLdge.org](/contact?recipient=service){:target="_blank"}

Thank you,  
Service Committee
