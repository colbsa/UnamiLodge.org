Hello Brothers,

Coming up very soon is the deadline for award nominations! If you feel like a brother is worthy of one of our awards you can go nominate at UnamiLodge.org/awards. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to the lodge operations committee.

To see past recipients of our awards, [visit UnamiLodge.org.org/history](/history).

Yours in Brotherhood,
