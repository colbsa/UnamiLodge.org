The Rules and Procedures of Unami Lodge, One serves as the governing document of the lodge. It outlines our identity and organization, as well as the structure of the lodge executive committee member. Any changes to the rules and procedures must be approved by both the lodge executive committee and the general lodge membership. The rules and procedures are also supplemented by five appendices focusing on the election of lodge officers, the organization and responsibilities of the lodge executive committee, awards and recognitions, and lodge finances. If you have changes to suggest for the rules and procedures, please contact the Lodge Operations Committee at lodgeoperations@unamilodge.org.
