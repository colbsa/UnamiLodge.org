A Lodge needs leaders and leaders need to hone their skills. Join us this year at the annual Lodge Leadership Development! Whether you are an active member on the Lodge Executive Committee or an Arrowmen with interest in becoming a better leader, this program is for you.

This will be a day long event full of leadership oriented trainings and discussions to make you and our Lodge the best it can be. A portion of the day will be focussed on the past and future of our Lodge so be prepared to help guide us toward tomorrow!

Let us know you are interested by signing up now. There is no cost, other than your time and the rewards can be countless for both you and the lodge as a whole.
