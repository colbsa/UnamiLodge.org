Join us this new year at the Lodge's 107th Annual Dinner! This is one of the oldest traditions of not only Unami Lodge, but across the nation in the Order of the Arrow. At this dinner we will celebrate this past year with awards and recognitions. We will look forward to this coming year with the State of the Lodge and good food filling us.

**The Night Sky and Beyond** is the theme and it will surely be an enlightening endeavor. As always with the annual dinner, friends and family are more than welcome to join! Patch auctions, and door prizes will be available so make sure to arrive on time.

Join us in thanking our past officers and LEC as well as say 'hello' to our future! Don't forget to be the first to congratulate the winners of this years Oustanding Service Awards, Spirit of Camp Leadership Awards, Founder's Award and more!

If you have any questions, let the dinner committee know at dinner@unamilodge.org.
